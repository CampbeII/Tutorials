# Tutorials
I like to document my process when learing new concepts. This is a collection of "how tos" and tutorials that i've written for myself.

## Virtualizing my AWS workflow
After chatting with ~~wizards~~ senior engineers I realized my workflow sucks. In order to make it suck less, I need to separate my workflow into:

- A development environment (hosted locally)
- A private repo on GitHub

Everything needs to work together seamlessly using what I currently consider as **black magic**.
