# Tutorials
I like to document my process when learing new concepts. This is a collection of "how tos" and tutorials that i've written for myself. 

## 1. Virtualizing my AWS workflow With Docker
After chatting with ~~wizards~~ senior engineers I realized my workflow sucks. In order to make it suck less, I need to separate my workflow into:

- A production environment on AWS
- A development environment (hosted locally)
- A private repo on GitHub

I've heard it mentioned everywhere, but i've never understood why I would want to use it. 
Here is my quest to go from completely oblivious to hopefully competant using docker.  [Getting started with docker](docker/README.md)

## 2. Security
