# Cracking Shadow hashes
To crack the shadow file we need access to 2 files:

1. `/etc/shadow`
2. `/etc/passwd`

## Unshadow
Part of the john suite, unshadow needs to combine the 2 files to crack the password:

```sh
unshadow [path to passwd] [path to shadow]

unshadow /etc/shadow /etc/passwd > result.txt
```

## Cracking
Using the newly created `result.txt` file we can try the crack as usual.
Note: You may need to include the `format` switch

```sh
john --wordlist=rockyou.txt result.txt


john --wordlist=rockyou.txt --format=sha512crypt result.txt
```
