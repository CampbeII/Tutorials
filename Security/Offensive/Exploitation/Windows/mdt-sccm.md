# Microsoft Deployment Toolkit (MDT)
Assists with automating the deployement of Microsoft OS by allowing base images to be maintained and updated in a central location. 

# System Center Configuration Manager
Manages updates for all microsoft applications, services, and OS. 

## PXE Boot
- Used in large organization to allow new devices connected to the network to load and install the OS over a connection. 
- MDT is used to create, manage, and host PXE boot images
- Integrated with DHCP meaning that if an ip is assigned the host is authorized to request the boot image

### Between DHCP and User
1. User sends DHCP Discover (Requests IP and PXE service info)
2. Server sends DHCP offer (open IP and PXE service info)
3. User sends DHCP (accepts IP address)
4. Server sends DHCP Acknowledge

### MDT Server and User
5. Client performs Boot Service Discover
6. Server acknowledge (sends PXE boot infomation)
7. Client requests PXE boot via TFTP
8. Server delivers PXE boot via TFTP

### Exploits
- Inject a priviledge escalation vector such as a local admin account.
- Password scrapting attacks to recover AD credentials used during install.

## PXE Boot Image Retrieval

1. Request IP and the PXE boot preconfigure via DHCP
2. Log into device and enable ssh for all users
```sh
cd Documents
mkdir User1
copy C:\powerpxe User1
cd User1
```
