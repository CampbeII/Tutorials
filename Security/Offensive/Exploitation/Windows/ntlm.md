# New Technology LAN Manager (NTLM)
The suite of security protocols used to authenticae users' identities in Active Directory. Authenticate is provided by a NetNTLM. 

NetNTLM can be found in:

- Internally-hosted Exchange servers that expose an Outlook Web App (OWA) login portal.
- RDP service of a server.
- VPN endpoints integrated with AD
- Internet facing web applications 

## How does it work?
- In between client and Active Directory
- All authentication material is forwarded to a domain controller
- Challenge goes to domain controller and if successful authenticates the user
- Application authenticates on behalf of user preventing it from storing credentials

Allows the application to act as a middle-man between client and AD.  All authentication material is forwarded to a Domain controller in the form of a challenge.
