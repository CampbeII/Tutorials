# Clientside Bypasses
Clientside bypass is done inside the browser and can by circumvented by sending a request directly to the endpoint.

## Method 1 - Curl
Send a request directly to the endpoint `http://site.com/uploads/images`

`-i` - Include Response headers. 

`-v` - See Request headers.

`-X` - Custom Request Method. 

`-F` - Set a form. `name=value`. Prefix with `@` to indicate a file.

```sh
curl -i -X POST -F "fileToUpload=@image.jpg" -F "name=testname" http://site.com/uploads/images
```
