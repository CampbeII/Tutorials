# OAuth Definitions

## Resource Owner
A person or system that controls data and can authorize an application to access that data on their behalf.

## Client
Mobile or web application that acts as an intermediary. The client will request access to resources and perform actions permitted by the resource owner. 

## Authorization Server
Issues access tokens to the client after successfully authenticating the resource owner and obtaining their authorizzation.

## Resource Server
Accepts and responds to protected resource requests using access tokens. This ensures that only authenticated and authorized clients can access the data.

## Authorization Grant
Client uses a credential that represents the resource owners authorization to obtain an access token. Primary grants are:
- Authorization Code
- Implicit
- Resource Owner Password Credentials
- Client Credentials

## Access Token
A credential used by the client to access protected resources on behalf of the resource owner. It should have limited access and scope.

## Refresh Token
A credential used by the client used to obtain a new access token without having te re-authenticate.

## Redirect URI
Location to redirect the resource owners user agent after the granting or denial of authorization.

## Scope
Mechanism for limiting an applications access to a user account.

## State Parameter
An optional parameter that maintains the state between the client and the authorization server. It can prevent CSRF attacks by ensuring the response matches the client request.

## Token & Authorization Endpoint
Where the client exchanges the authorization grant or refresh token for an access token.
