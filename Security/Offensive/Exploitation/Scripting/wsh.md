# Windows Scripting Host
Built in windows administration tool that runs batch files to automate and manage tasks. 

## Set Variables
This will set a variable and display it in a popup alert on windows.

hello.vbs
```
Dim message
message = "Hello there."
MsgBox message
```

You can run it using:

`wscript hello.vbs`

## Using VBScript
Create an object of the `WScript` library using `CreateObject` to call the execution payload.

payload.vbs
```
Set shell = WScript.CreateObject("Wscript.Shell")
shell.run("C:\Windows\System32\calc.exe" & WScript.ScriptFullName),0,True
```

Run it using:

`wscript c:\payload.vbs`

or using 

`cscript.exe c:\payload.vbs`

## Evading Blocks
Rename a file to `.txt` and run it using:

`wscript /e:VBScript c:\payload.txt`
