# Evaison Techniques

## Packing and Obfuscation
A packer will compress, obfuscate, and encrypt the contents of your malware. Packed malware will not show important information when running a string search against it. 

Additionally `pecheck` will not contain `.text` sections and other sections will have execute permissions. This indicates that these sections contain executable instructions or will be populated with executable instructions during execution.

## Sandbox Evaison
The following techniques can be used to detect, and evade malware analysis efforts

1. Long sleep calls
Sandboxes run for a limited time. Therefore by adding a beneign, long running process before executing malware may timeout a sandbox before it reads the malicious code.

2. User Activity
Sandboxes will not contain a user and therefore there will be no user activity. Keystrokes, mouse movement, and other user behaviours can be used to differentiate between an actual device and a sandbox.

3. User Footprints
Day to day usage will create temporary files, emails, browsing history, etc. The absence of these common files could indicate a sandbox.

4. VM Detection
Virtual machines leave artifacts such as drivers that can be used to identify them.
