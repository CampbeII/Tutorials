## Clean up duplicate passwords
`sort list.txt | uniq -u > cleaned-list.txt`

## CEWL
Cewl is a tool that will crawl a target and extract keywords.

| Command | Purpose |
| ------- | ------- |
| `-w` | write contents to file |
| `-m 5` | minimum 5 character words (default 3)| 
| `-d 5` | depth (default 2) | 

### Example
`cewl -w list.txt -d 5 -m 5 http://target`

## Crunch
Create all the possibilities for a range of characters.

| Command | Purpose |
| ------- | ------- |
| `2` | min |
| `2` | max | 
| `01234abcd` | character range |
| `-o` | output file |
| `-t` | Specifies a pattern where only the special chars change |

`crunch 2 2 01234abcd -o result.txt`

## CUPP - Common User Passwords Profiler
Generate wordlists based on birthdays, pets names, company names etc
[CUPP Repo](https://github.com/Mebus/cupp)

## John the Ripper
Apply rules based on password policy

### List Rules
List all the rules available:

```sh
cat /etc/john/john.conf | grep "List.Rules:" | cut -d "." -f3 | cut -d":" -ft | cut -d"]" -f1 | awk NFA
```

### Generate Rule-Based Password List
Generate a password list using a pre defined rule set.

```sh
john --wordlist=target.lst -rules=rulename --stdout > results.txt
```

### Common Wordlists
- best64
- korelogic

### Add A Rule To John the Ripper
Add a rule that add a special character to the start of each generated password in `target.lst`

```sh
[List.Rules:thm]
Az"[0-9]" ^[!@#$]
```

`Az` - represents a word from the wordlist
`[0-9]` - append a single digit
`^[!@#$]` - add a special character at the begining of each word
