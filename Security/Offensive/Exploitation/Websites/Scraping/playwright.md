playwright install
```

import asyncio 
from playwright.async_api import async_playwright

async def main():
    async with async_playwright() as pw:
        browser = await pw.firefox.launch(headless=True)
        page = await browser.new_page()
        await page.goto(target)
        await page.wait_for_timeout(5000)

        forms = await page.query_selector_all('form')

if __name__ == '__main__':
    asyncio.run(main())
```

## Page Content
To return the html page:
```py
html = await page.content()
```

## Locators
Forms:
- Cannot be found by getRole unless they are accessible.
- Use page.locator('form') instead
```py
forms = page.locator('form').all()
form.get_attribute('action')
```

Filling in inputs:
```py
await page.locator('input').fill('test')
```
