# Types of Injection

## 1. In-Band
Same communication channel for both injection and retrieving data.

### 1.1 Error-Based Injection
Manipulate the request until you see an error.

### 1.2 Union-Base Injection
Combine multiple result sets to return data from multiple tables.

## 2. Out-of-band
Uses the database server to send query results to the attacker.

## 3. Inferential
With no ability to see errors or a response, you'll need to evaluate how the application responds.

### 3.1 Boolean-Based 
Send query to database returning a result based on a true or false condition.
```sql
SELECT * FROM users weher id = 1 AND 1=1 // True 
SELECT * FROM users weher id = 1 AND 1=1 // False 
```

### 3.2 Time-Based
Adding a delay or large query to test your queries.
```sql
SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = 1; IF (1=1) WAITFOR DELAY '00:00:005'--
```
