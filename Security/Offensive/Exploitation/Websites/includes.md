# Webserver Includes
An example attack that exploits server side includes.

1. Run an nmap SYN scan on all ports.
```sh
nmap -sS -Pn -p- -T5 10.10.10.10 -oA scan.results
```

Discovered ports:

| Port | Service | Notes |
| ---- | ------- | ----- |
| 22 | SSH |
| 25 | SMTP |
| 110 | POP3 |
| 143 | IMAP |
| 993 | IMAPS |
| 995 | POP3s |
| 4000 | REMOTEANYTHING | Login page |
| 50000 | ibm-db2 | Sysmon |

2. Manual testing
- Sign into the web application using a guest account.
- Explore the user actions. In this case we can recommend an activity to the user
- We notice this overides their variables
- Recommend a new activity `isAdmin` with a value of true to overide their permissions.
- A new area called 'API' will be unlocked. Here we can see confidential api calls.d

3. Find a way to make an internal call from the web application.
- Under setting we can specify a new link for an image.
- Use a local link to see the result of the restricted api call

```json
{"ReviewAppUsername":"admin","ReviewAppPassword":"admin@!!!","SysMonAppUsername":"administrator","SysMonAppPassword":"S$9$qk6d#**LQU"}
```

4. Fuzz
```sh
gobuster dir -u "$url" -w wordlist.txt
```
