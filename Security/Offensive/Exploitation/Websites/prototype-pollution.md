# Prototype Pollution
A vulnerability that can occur in any system that uses prototype-based inheritance. Very common is JS web applications.

## How it works
Consider this very basic example:
```js
let PersonPrototype = {
    introduce: () => {
        return "Hello, i'm ${this.name}";
    }
}
```

The prototype function is then extended by the `Person` function:
```js
function Person(name) {
    let person = Object.create(PersonPrototype);
    person.name = name;
    return person;
}
```

When we create an instance, we now have access to `introduce()` 
```js
let john = Person('John');
```

## Exploitable Properties

| Property | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `__proto__` | Allow you to access the top level |
| `toString` | Convent characters to string |
| `toJSON` | Object to json |
| `valueOf` |  Convert to primitive |
| `constructor` | Function constructor |

## Checking for Vulnerabilities
- Check to see if any user input can affect the prototype chain.
- Try to override properties.
- Need an understanding of the code / purpose.
