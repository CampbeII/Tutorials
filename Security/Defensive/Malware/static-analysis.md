# Static Analysis
Accomplished without executing the malware.

## File Types
In some cases the file extension will not match the actual file type of the malware.
```sh
file malwaresample.ps1

malwaresample.ps1: PE32 executable (GUI) Intel 80386, for MS Wnidows
```
We can determine the following from that output:
- PE32 executable
- Graphical User Interface
- Compiled for Microsoft Windows 
- Intel 80386-base processesor
- Designed for 32-bit processors

## Strings
The `strings` command will list all the strings in the file. This will help provide context at a glance. In most cases this output will be quite large and you will want to redirect it to a file.
```sh
strings malwaresample.ps1

hello
world
Invoke-WebRequest
```

## Hashes
This can be used to identify the integrity of a file.  The commands are simple and follow the syntax `hash + sum` filename

| Hash | Description |
| ---- | ----------- |
| `md5sum` | MD5 check |
| `sha1sum` | sha1 check |
| `sha256sum` | sha256 check |

## Virus Total
Is a great tool to identify commom malicious files, urls, and addresses.


## PE Header
Contains the metadata about a Portable Executable file.

### Imports / Exports
Imports are commonly used to reduce redundancy in a code base. There is no need to re-write code when it is likely contained within the OS already.

Exports are generally associated with DLL files and allow functions to be exposed to other binaries.


### Sections
A PE file is divided into sections which have different purposes.

| Section | Description |
| `.text:` | CPU instructions executed |
| `.data:` | Global variables |
| `.rsrc:` | Resources such as images |
